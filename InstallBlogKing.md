Installation of the Blog King plugin package

# New Install #

1. You should install the standard wordpress as usual

2. checkout the Blog King Package via [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/blog-king/source) (as long as there is no separate download)

3. upload the Blog King sources onto your webspace

4. login and check your plugins area


# Install in existing Wordpress #

If you have a running wordpress with all kinds of plugins, you should make sure that your existing plugins are not already in the blog King package.

The simple way of doing this is just uploading the Blog King and enabling the different plugins areas (Frontend / Admin / ..)
Then you can compare your addons and manually delete your old doubles.

# I want to use my old and other Plugins #
If you have a plugins which are not in the King Package you can safely keep / isntall them.
The only difference in the Blog King plugins directory is the further division into subfolders, to keep the pluginarea/folder clean. For this reason some integrated plugins had to be adapted because they are using absolute paths to refer to some of their files.
