The Blog King is a big bundle of Wordpress Plugins. It consist of Plugins written by me and 3rd Party Plugins.

Everytime you are using Wordpress to build up a blog or website you have the need for the same plugins. So i started to keep them in one place so i can easily update my old projects and quickly start new ones.

I used to host a couple of those Plugins and King Widgets on my blog (see links), but this is to hard for me to maintain.

The plugins are constantly evolving, with every project, i use them in. There are still some Plugins in there, that might not work or are just experimental. With over 50 Plugins its not that easy to keep up with the development.

You probably won´t need all anyway, so on the Wiki pages i´ll try to point you to the important/stable ones wich you can´t get anywhere else.

Since i don´t have the time to seperatly pack and link every one of my plugins, you need to have an SVN Client like TortoiseSVN (windows) to checkout or watch the changes in the code repository.
